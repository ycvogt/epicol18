# **EPICOL18 \- Corpus Query Interface**

### **📖 About EPICOL18 WebApp** 

The Corpus of Long Eighteenth-Century Epistolary Novels (EPICOL18) lends itself well for genre-specific research questions, text-specific research questions, stylometry and author stylistic analyses. It may also lend itself well for historical corpus linguistic questions, but it should be considered that the spelling was modernised.

### 📜 **Corpus Structure** 

The texts for this corpus were collected from online databases and archives such as Project Gutenberg, The Oxford Text Archive, The Online Books Page at the University of Pennsylvania, Early English Books Online (EEBO), and Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO). The texts themselves are not necessarily the originally published edition, but rather those that are available on the afore-mentioned platforms. What is counted here, is the original publication date of the text.

Selection criteria:

* fictional text  
* vast majority/all of the text is in letter correspondences  
* not a translation  
* written by a British author  
* originally published between 1680 and 1820  
* acceptable transcription quality and completion"  
* electronically accessible  
* copyright free

The time frame for this corpus is set from the years leading up to the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the years following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the death of George III in 1820\. This time-frame might however be under revision, depending on how the corpus will continue to evolve. Literary resources were           consulted to find and also verify whether a novel qualified as "epistolary" (Beebee 1999, Bray 2003 and others). The corpus was originally designed for my Master's Thesis Project, which analysed lexico-grammatical patterns in the meta-discourse on proper and improper behaviour through collocations. For that reason, the corpus size had to be manageable enough for qualitative contextualization, but also big enough for             statistically sound results. Now, the corpus may be expanded further to allow for a more comprehensive overview of the texts.

The text was edited to match the modernised spelling in VARD2, and front/back matter as well as chapter headers were removed. For example, remov’d was normalized to removed, ca to can (split from tokenization can’t) and Further manual edits were done to eliminate annotations that might impact machine-readability. Any research concerning old spelling variants or the novel structure is not possible. 

The following table describes the structure of EPICOL.

Tokens are counted as ….  
Types represent unique words and lemmas are the number of unique word root forms.   
Of the 28 texts,spanning over 4 million words.

This corpus was also tagged for parts-of-speech and tokenized with the spacy tagger and tokenizer, which uses the Universal POS-Tag Set. The tagged results were checked and a domain-specific vocabulary with POS-tag mapping was created for frequent mistakes, in addition to manual correction after inspection. This tagger tags with roughly 97 percent reported accuracy for modern texts, and did quite well here as well.

### **💡 Functions and Features (with Examples/Screenshots)**

1. **Top Words and Parts-of-Speech** 

Based on your text and POS-Tag selection, a word cloud with the key terms (top 100), i.e. most frequent words excluding stopwords, of the selected books and selected tag option will be generated.  You can then choose to download the resulting image (PNG). As default option, the key terms calculated from all texts are displayed. 

2. **N-Grams** 

Based on your text selection and a search term of your choice (using Regex), and a selection of POS-Tags, create word n-grams spanning two to five words and display their frequencies in a table and a barplot. If you just select a text and do not enter a search term, the most frequent n-grams of the text are shown. 

By default, the text search is case-insensitive as all ngrams are lowercased.   
Note: this tool does not allow looping over the entire corpus

3. **Text Search** 

Search for an individual word or phrase (using Regex) in a selection of texts. By default, the text search is case-sensitive. to receive results that exactly match your search term casing.

4. **Key-Word in Context (KWIC)** 

Enter a search term of your choice (no phrases) to look up their immediate contexts and in which texts they appear.

### 🔍 **Technical Details and Requirements**

The app uses Dash for the frontend, Flask as the web server, and SQL for storing and querying the corpus database. It is written in Python and uses an additional style sheet in CSS to add to the HTML structures.  
In the documentation, refer to libraries, APIs, or tools you used and explain how they integrate with your app (e.g., Dash, Plotly, Pandas, NLTK).
